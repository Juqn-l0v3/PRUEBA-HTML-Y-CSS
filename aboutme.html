        Hello, I am Juan Diego Figueroa Ramos.
        I like creating code, I like technology, I'm 18 years old, I like all kinds of music, as long as it's not
        really heavy metal haha, but I listen to any kind of music, especially reggaeton and rap from Medellin, and
        I'm willing to learn everything about development.
